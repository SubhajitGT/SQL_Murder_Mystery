Problem Description:
A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, 
but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ?murder? that occurred sometime on ?Jan.15, 2018? 
and that it took place in ?SQL City?. 
Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

SQL statements:
select distinct type from crime_scene_report; -- types of crime
select distinct date from crime_scene_report; -- date pattern in DB, Murder happened on 15th Jan,2018(roughly)20180115
select * from crime_scene_report where type='murder' and date=20180115 and 
city ='SQL City';
select * from person where address_street_name='Northwestern Dr' order by address_number;
select * from person where address_street_name='Franklin Ave' and name like 'Annabel%';
